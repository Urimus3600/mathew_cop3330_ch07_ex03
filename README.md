This is a calculator in which basic mathematic operations can be performed

Constants                                                                                         *****
pi - predefined to be a const variable of value 3.1415926535
e - predefined to be a const variable of value 2.7182818284
k - predefined to be a const variable of value 1000

Normal operators                                                                                  *****
() - parentheses, must be used together
+  - addition
-  - subtraction
*  - multiplication, cannot be forgone or it will be an error
/  - division, cannot be 0 for second number, else error
%  - remainder, second number must be an integer, else error
=  - assignment, can only be done to variables, variables cannot share names with commands or functions
   - format reassignment: var_name = expression;
   - format reassignment as const: const var_name = expression;

Commands                                                                                          *****
let   - declaration of variable
      - variable names must start with a letter, can include digits, letters, and underscores
      - format: let var_name = expression;
      - format const: let const var_name = expression;
exit  - ends program, note: if attached to statement or expression this will not occur
const - once a variable is said to be const after or during its declaration, it cannot be changed

Functions                                                                                         *****
sqrt(expression) - takes in expression or double value and outputs the square root
pow(expression1, expression2) - takes in two expressions or doubles, the second parameter must be an 
                                integer, else error
                                
How to Write Statement or Expressions                                                             *****
mathematical statements and expressions or values must be ended by a ; character
if answer does not appear immediately, hit enter or ;
multiple can be input on a line and the answers will outputted sequentially
